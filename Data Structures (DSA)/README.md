# Data Structures and Algorithm

*Programs based on data structures like :*

* Array
* Linked List
  * Singly Linked List
  * Doubly Linked List
  * Circular Linked List
* Queue
  * Normal Queue
  * Circular Queue
* Stack
  * Using Array
  * Using Linked List
* Tree
  * Binary Tree
  * Traversal

#### NOTE : All these programs, their functions, diffferent form of Implementations and programs based on these data structures are also present
